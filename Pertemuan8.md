At previous meetings we have discussed about Firewall. What is the firewall, what it does, how it works and the functionality of the firewall itself. At this meeting we will discuss the Intrusion Detection System, or better known as IDS. Before entering in the material IDS let the review of the firewall itself first.

    A firewall is a system or device that allows network traffic that is considered safe for traffic through it and prevent an unsecured network. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on the gate (gateway) between the local network and other networks. Firewalls are also commonly used to control access to anyone who has access to a private network from outside parties. Today, the term firewall becomes a generic term that refers to a system that manages the communication between two different networks.

discussion:

DEFINITION IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

   IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a system of monitoring the network traffic and monitoring of suspicious activities in a network system. If it is found that the activities mencurigakanberhubungan with trafficjaringan then IDS will alert the system or network administrator.

    In many cases IDS also respond to traffic that is not normal / anomaly by blocking the action of a user or IP address (Internet Protocol) network accessing sources of business. IDS itself appeared with several types and a different approach that essentially serves to detect suspicious traffic within a network. Some types of IDS are: network-based (NIDS) and host-based (HIDS). There IDS works by detecting the search based on the specific characteristics of the trials are often performed. This method is similar to how the antivirus software to detect and protect the system against threats.

   Then there is also the IDS that works by detecting based on a comparison of normal traffic patterns that exist and then look for abnormalities of existing traffic. There IDS function only as a supervisor and warning when the attack occurred and there are IDS that works not only as a supervisor and a warner, but also can perform an activity which responds to the attempted attack against the network and computer systems.

Type - the type of IDS




NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)
   IDS is placed in a place of this type / strategic point or a point within a network to monitor the traffic that goes and comes from all devices (devices) in the network. Ideally, all traffic originating from outside and within the network to do the scan, but this way can cause bottlenecks that interfere with access speeds across the network.
    
HIDS (Host intrution Detection System)
  This type of IDS running on the host stand-alone or equipment in a network. A HIDS monitoring the packets originating from inside or from the outside only on one device and then alerts the user or administrator of the network system will be their suspicious the activities detected by HIDS.

conclusion:
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a system of monitoring the network traffic and monitoring of suspicious activities in a network system. IDS possessed two types, namely NIDS and HIDS.
With a firewall in a computer network system expected to protect important information and can manage the traffic accesses from within and from outside the system. In order to improve the performance of all parts - part related to achieving kemaksimalan a connection or jariangan from within and outside the beneficial effects to the user (user).
Many IDS applications that exist today, but the most widely used is the application of Snort. Because in addition to free Snort also supports all platforms and various operating systems. In addition it is also based on open source Snort.
