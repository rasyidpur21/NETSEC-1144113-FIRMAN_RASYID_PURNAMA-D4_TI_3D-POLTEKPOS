Background :
On this occasion I will explain a little about the ARP Poisoning. ARP Poisoning What the heck is that? Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing is a technique used to attack an Ethernet wired or wireless network. Can the URLs if ARP Spoofing is like an attack in which an attacker attempting to send fake ARP broadcast mass on the LAN. Fake ARP contains the statement that the Mac Address of the perpetrator's own IP from other hosts (eg IP Gateway). The point ya guys attack can only be done on the network that really take advantage of the ARP guys opened it another method of address resolution.

discussion:
ARP Spoofing is basically aimed to associate the address of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another node (such as the default gateway). And technically, ARP spoofing intended that all data packets that pass can bypass the computer attacker or attackers. By doing so the attacker can mount an attack such as: DNS posioning, Sniffing Attack, Cut Network, Network Limit and others.
In doing ARP Spoofing there is one program that used that program scapy, yes you could say scapy it is toolnya ARP Spoofing. Scapy What the heck is that? Scapy is a program created using python programming language that is very "powerful" in the interaction to manipulate the packets on the network. Scapy able to build up and break down the packages of various types of existing protocols. So, essentially scapy it serves to manipulate tissue.
ARP Spoofing can still be prevented by securing the transmitted packets and installing screening policies. We can also use a signature for packages that communicate within their own network, in order to ensure that the package can not be modified to transmit.

conclusion:
ARP poisoning is a technique that is used to perform network security attacks or hacking.
One of the programs used for ARP spoofing is scapy, where scapy functions for manipulating tissue.
ARP poisoning can still be prevented, but difficult to overcome when it was exposed to attacks within the network security system.
