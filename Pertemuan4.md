Background :
In this modern age, many people are using the Internet to facilitate the work of man. Such as searching for information, exchange of information through social media and so on. All that we can easily access through the Internet. However, over the times, there are also people who access the Internet in a way that is less well as by sniffing.
Sniffing itself is a practice of reading the IP packets from one node to another node to perform the method of intercepting network. So, people who do sniffing will be entered into the path through which packets of data that are targeted will pass or be passed. Through this pathway target access rights can be known by the hacker.

Sniffing What is it?
As already explained, sniffing is the practice of reading the IP packets from one node to another node. The method used in sniffing is a method of intercepting, which the hacker network will enter into the path of data packets through the target.
Data traveling on the network to flow back and forth will be captured by using sniffing sometimes describes the contents of a request for comment or other specifications. When viewed from the structure of the web, either party can tap the whole or any of the traffic division of one of the machines in the network. Network control devices can also be set by an application or tool tapper to work at random or random.
example:
Wifi campus has two users are lecturers and students. Here students role as sniffer using sniffing. When lecturers use wifi hotspot campus, the professors will put data packets into a wifi network in the form of usernames, passwords, form which contains methot post or get, and other specifications. Then sniffing will capture the data that the sniffer will know the contents of the data or cross paths traversed by the data packets in the network wifi campus faculty. These data will be manipulated by students to the hotspot login by using the account of lecturers. The structure can be seen as the image above.

Actually, there are several ways to avoid the use of sniffing tool by others. One of the ways that we can use is to increase our network security system. For example by changing the HTTP to HTTPS. With HTTPS can encrypt the data that we had with using AES or higher again. The higher the encryption of the data we have, the more difficult sniffer intercepting packet data we have so much safer.

conclusion:
From the above statement we can conclude that sniffing can read data that we have such as username and password. In melakukannyapun can be easily done, because it has provided an application or tool that can allow sniffing.

Suggestion :
If you want to make sniffing then do it wisely and carefully. Do not let any other parties who feel aggrieved.
