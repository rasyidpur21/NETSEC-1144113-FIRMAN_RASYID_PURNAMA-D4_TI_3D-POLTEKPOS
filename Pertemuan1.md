WHAT IS NETWORK SECURITY?


   In language Network Security can be defined as a network security. All associated with the Internet there are a lot of important data whether the company's data, personal data stored in various social media and are in the Internet network. This is where the role of Network Security works. Where the Network Security role is to secure the critical data contained in a network that is not accessible to others.
    
LAYER OSI (Open Systems Interconnections)

   OSI layer useful as learning. form has not been realized due to less than ideal. For implementation is currently being used is TCP / IP.
     OSI Layer reference model illustrates how information from a software application in a computer is moved across a network medium to a software application in another computer.
   Model Open Systems Interconnections was created by the International Organization for Standardization (IOS), which provides a framework logic of how processes interact data communication network.
     
     TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a computer network software (networking software) contained in the system, and used in data communications in a local area network (LAN) or the Internet. Also means that TCP / IP is a group of protocols that govern communication computer data on the internet. This protocol is a protocol that is most used today. The data are implemented in software (software) operating system. The term given to this software is the TCP / IP stack. Networking on TCP / IP communication is physical hardware that has an address or Mac Address.
      TCP / IP is not equipped with a security module, so that the engineer vying for manipulating the network security, because TCP / IP are vulnerable.
Architecture TCP / IP

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

      Protocol ARP or Address Resolution Protocol is a protocol that is responsible for finding out the Mac Address or the hardware address of a host belonging to a LAN by utilizing or based on the IP address configured on the host in question. In the OSI layer, this protocol berkeja between Layer 2 and Layer 3.
