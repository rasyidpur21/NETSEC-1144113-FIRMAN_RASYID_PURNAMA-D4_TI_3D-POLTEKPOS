Background :
In the use of network security systems, there are still many things that can harm network users. Because there is no network security system is completely secure. Once we're on a network, then there must be a malicious parties to penetrate the network that we have. And this can be detrimental to the users of the network, because of the personal data or privacy of their own can be accessed by other people, and even they can change data held by network users. One way to access another person's network is to conduct spoofing.

discussion:
Spoofing is a technique that is performed to gain illegal access to a network of computer or information which the hacker to have a connection with the user by means of falsified data to create a reliable host.

ARP spoofing is a concept attack intercepts between the two machines communicate with each other or we can also refer to the Man In The Middle Attack.

DNS Spoofing is a process that does the fetching DNS name of another system with harmful or detrimental to the domain server.

example:
A professor wants to connect to the Internet using a computer, just think of this faculty computer is Computer A. To terhuung with the Internet, Computer A to go through the router first. A computer can go to the router by looking at the table alternative that he had, then there is a Hacker and we consider it as a computer B that tries to deceive computer A so that it can not connect or connected to the Internet by giving the table a fake against the computer A, so that computer A view false table obtained from Computer B and Computer B is regarded router. From this process, automatically streams Internet network access to Computer A will be disconnected so that it can not connect.

conclusion:
The conclusion that can be drawn from the above statement is spoofing is a tool or a tool that can give a false address to the victim so that the victim can not connect to the Internet.

Suggestion :
To prevent spoofing make the data do not accept from anyone the table and create a static table that can not be changed or updated.
