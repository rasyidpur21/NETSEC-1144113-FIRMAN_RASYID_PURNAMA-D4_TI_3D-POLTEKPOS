BACKGROUND :

       Cryptography is derived from the Greek, according to the language is divided into two crypto and Graphia, crypto means secret (secret) and Graphia means writing (writing). According teminologinya cryptography is the science and art to maintain the security of the message when the message is sent from one place to another.
      Implementation of cryptographic very much we can meet in everyday life, such as Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), use of ATMs for banking, even began to increase to Internet Banking, Mobile Banking, Electronic communication such as landline telephone, cellular, SMS, MMS. 3G, Communication via the Internet such as email, messaging, chat, Voice Call and E-Government, E-Commence

DISCUSSION:

       Cryptography is the science and art to maintain the security of the message when the message is sent from one place to another. Various kinds of cryptography:
1. Encode is changing the data into another form.
    Example :
· RGW, Hex
· ASC11, Hex
2. Decode is the opposite of encode, to change other forms of data into a form that can be read.
     Example :
· Hex, RGB
· Hex, ASC11
3. Encryption adalahmerubah data into a form that can not be read by using a key.
     Example :
RSA
4. Decryption is meruabah form of transcription of data into data that can be read megunakan key.
    Example:
Public key / in the share
Private Key / saved.
5. Hashing is the process of data processing in the same direction.
    Example :
md5
Cryptography This is used to check the downloaded files to be seen whether any editing middle of the road.

CONCLUSION:
Cryptography is one of the communication and information media ancient still used to this day in Indonesia cryptography called coding which can briefly be meaningful art to protect data and information from parties - both parties are not desired when transmitted and when it is stored. there are many kinds of cryptography, including Encode, Decode, Encryption, Decryption, and Hashing.
