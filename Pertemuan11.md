BACKGROUND :
In a large company must have branches scattered in many places. The branch office would have a need to interact with each other or in other words a place definitely needs a relationship with other places.
In the early days of computer networks, a solution commonly used is to build a private network that connects all of the branch or place an existing or commonly called a Wide Area Network (WAN).
With the development of Internet network, a more efficient solution is the establishment of private network across the public network is often known as a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Forms of such networks requires a good security system so that the private network can not be accessed by unauthorized users.
 
DISCUSSION:
Virtual Private Network or VPN is a private network that is created by using a public network, or in other words to create a WAN that is actually separated both physically and geographically so logically form a netwok single, packet data flowing between sites or from users who do remote access will have encryption and authentication to ensure the security, integrity and validity of the data.
More specifically, the VPN is a secure virtual private that is why it is so called because basically this network does not physically exist only in the form of virtual networks and why they are called private because this network is a network of private nature that not everyone can access it. VPN Connecting the PC to the network public or private nature of the Internet however, because it is private so not everyone can be connected to this network and access it.
 
CONCLUSION:
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure virtual / virtual private nature that not everyone can access it. VPN has three main functions in the data security, namely, Confidentially (Confidentiality of Data), Data Integrity (Integrity of Data) and Origin Authentication (Authentication Source). Related to how VPN works, can work with a VPN requires a server as a liaison between the client. When the client accesses the data, the request will be encrypted in advance by the VPN Client before it is sent to the VPN Server, eg encrypted with A formula that requests the data will contain code. After arriving to the VPN Server, the Server data be described by the formula A, having previously been configured between the server and the client, the server will have the same algorit to read an encryption. Likewise from Server to Client.
