Background :
At the meeting of 6 in the Network Security course we will discuss about the Denial Of Service. If we discuss about Network Security, then we will not be familiar with the word hacker. Yes hackers, people who are happy to break into security systems contained within a network. A hacker could damage or make the system work as it should, but if a hacker already has no way of hacking, there is one last way he can do that is by doing Denial Of Service (DOS).

discussion:
What's DOS? Denial Of Sevice / DOS This is the way that a hacker can do if he does not successfully entered into the system by creating a server preoccupied by our request so that the server could not serve another request.
If there is a request that is not only one request sender program, but there are few or many programs running on the sender requests made simultaneously, then this process can be called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS).

Servers that provide services of requests that have been sent by the client, making the server has more capacity to provide services to service client requests. DOS / DDOS is a way of working itself, where DOS / DDOS will make the server busy serving requests from a client, for example, a server has a limit on the number of clients that can he serve, then the attacker or what we call a hacker, will create a system which can make it possible for hackers to have a lot of programs running and can send requests to the server until the server is unable to serve requests again or can we call the "denied".
DOS / DDOS, there is no way that can be done to prevent it, because the attacked system is the system contained in a client-server system. But there are some ways that we can use to relieve us from attack by DOS / DDOS this. Among others are :
1. Increase the capacity of service if an attacker or hacker did not increase the capacity demand.
2. Blocking IP attacker or hacker through the firewall.
3. Incorporate all IP attacker inside the firewall.
4. Make Honey Pot.

conclusion:
From the discussion that has been mentioned above, we can conclude that DOS / DDOS is one way for a hacker to create a server in the network is busy with a lot of shipping requests so that the server is unable to serve all requests and processing will be denied.

Suggestion :
It is better if the experts conducting research that aims to address hacking through DOS / DDOS's, that can be used as a solution due to the lack of a way that can be done to prevent DOS / DDOS this.
