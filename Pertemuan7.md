Background :
The term firewall is one word that is no stranger to the duni network security. Not infrequently, the firewall has also been widely used in the world around us. For example, only employees in companies that have a computer network to interconnect computers in each division. Obviously there are many more examples that we can take in our surroundings and often times a lot of people who do not understand why and for what firewall itself. Here I will explain more or less what are the things you need to know about firewall.

discussion:

1. Understanding
In a computer network firewall is tasked to protect a computer or computer network from outside access that does not have access rights or authority to access the computer, such as the wall or walls are used as penlindung to the limit.

The computer network allows for us to be able to access each other and share important information with a certain rule, because a lot of people who can be interconnected in a computer network. Firewalls can be used to create a barrier or a defense to any computer filter that allowed any access, which should be blocked and the user which one can be considered unsafe.

Firewall can be either software or hardware application designed specifically to perform the use of firewalls.

2. Function Firewall
The existence of the firewall is very important in your network, especially if your computer is stored in the data of a company or private that is the secret. Surely you do not want anyone else can access this data by exploiting loopholes in the network and your computer.

Firewalls can block connections from the network or a specific IP. In addition the filter mechanism also help us in setting up the firewall so it is more flexible in accessing. Visually, the user is notified if there is access from the outside or access from the inside to the outside. We can determine if we allow this access.

If we have a control like this then we will be able to know the exit and entry of data to and from your computer. We can assume like having a security guard who was always checking people coming into our homes and out of our homes. If you are not interested then we can forbid entrance.

The function Firewalls in the network are as follows:
Packet Filtering: check the header of a TCP / IP (depending on network architecture, in this example is TCP IP) and decide whether these data have access to the network.
Network Address Translation (NAT): usually a have a public IP network and on the network itself has its own IP. Firewall serves to forward data packets from outside the network to the IP network properly according to the local computer.
Application Proxy: protocol application firewall can detect certain more specific.
Traffic management: record and monitor network traffic
There are many other firewall functions as the development of networks and technologies in software or hardware firewall.

3. Uses Firewalls
In general, the firewall function to protect computer networks from a variety of external threats are not entitled to obtain system privileges. For example, crackers are usually always try to take advantage of the other party by breaking into computer networks and conduct activities detrimental such as stealing data and damage the system. Obviously with the firewall such things are expected to avoid and overcome.

4. How Firewalls Work

When there is incoming data packets to a network or computer, the firewall will check the header of the packet data. Then use the network firewall rules to determine whether the packet data can be forwarded or not. If not then there will be blocking, if allowed then the data packet will be forwarded the appropriate mechanisms so that the network up to the computer in question.
And contrary to the packet data outside the firewall can be checked by IP and content. They are usually able to block network access to a division to a network resource. Or maybe blocking that contain pornographic content. Here firewall rules to filter such requests.
conclusion:
Viewed from the usability and functionality of the firewall so is important for us to be able to install a firewall so that the computer network that we have can be protected from network connections or a specific IP.
Suggestion :
Install the firewall on your pc or laptop in order to better protect the security of your network from things that are not desirable.
